Description:This project is built with Flask and Machine Learning. It collects student data through a web interface, including features like gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, test preparation course, reading, and writing scores. The data ingestion component loads and splits the dataset, while the data transformation pipeline handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical values. Multiple regression models (like Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost) are trained, evaluated, and the best-performing model is saved. The prediction pipeline loads the trained model and preprocessor, transforms incoming data, and returns the predicted math score. This system automates score predictions, helping identify factors influencing student performance and enabling targeted interventions for academic improvement.
